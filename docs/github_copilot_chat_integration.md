# GitHub Copilot Chat Integration

This document describes the GitHub Copilot Chat integration features added in version 0.5.0 of the AI Development Monitor.

## Overview

The AI Development Monitor now provides direct integration with GitHub Copilot Chat, allowing for programmatic interaction with the chat interface. This enables developers to:

1. Send "Continue" messages when accepting suggestions
2. Request changes with custom feedback
3. Access these features directly from the VS Code command palette

## Key Components

### CopilotChatIntegration Class

The `CopilotChatIntegration` class has been enhanced with the following methods:

- `sendMessageToChat(message, showNotification)`: Core function for sending any message to GitHub Copilot Chat
- `sendContinue(showNotification)`: Sends a "Continue" message to Copilot Chat
- `requestChanges(feedback, showNotification)`: Sends a request for changes with optional specific feedback

### Chat Panel Handling

The integration includes sophisticated chat panel detection and handling:

- Checks if the chat panel is already open
- Opens a new chat panel if needed
- Falls back to focusing an existing panel
- Uses appropriate timing delays for UI interactions

### Command Palette Integration

Two new commands have been added to the VS Code command palette:

1. **AI Monitor: Tell Copilot to Continue** (`ai-development-monitor.copilotChatContinue`)
   - Sends a "Continue" message to Copilot Chat
   - Shows a notification confirming the action

2. **AI Monitor: Request Changes from Copilot** (`ai-development-monitor.copilotChatRequestChanges`)
   - Prompts the user for specific feedback
   - Sends a formatted request for changes to Copilot Chat
   - Shows a notification confirming the action

## Usage

### Continue Command

When you accept a suggestion and want Copilot to continue generating code:

1. Open the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P / Cmd+Shift+P)
2. Type "AI Monitor: Tell Copilot to Continue"
3. Press Enter

This will send a "Continue" message to Copilot Chat, prompting it to generate more code.

### Request Changes Command

When you want to request changes to a suggestion:

1. Open the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P / Cmd+Shift+P)
2. Type "AI Monitor: Request Changes from Copilot"
3. Enter your specific feedback in the input box
4. Press Enter

This will send a request to Copilot Chat with your feedback.

## Implementation Details

The implementation uses VS Code's clipboard API and command execution to simulate user interaction with the chat panel. This approach provides a reliable way to interact with Copilot Chat without requiring direct access to its internal API.

## Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements for future versions include:

- Keyboard shortcuts for quick access to chat commands
- Status bar buttons for common chat interactions
- Enhanced error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Additional chat interaction commands for common tasks

# GitHub Copilot Test Execution

This document describes the test execution capabilities for GitHub Copilot Chat integration added in version 0.6.0 of the AI Development Monitor.

## Overview

The AI Development Monitor now provides the ability to automatically run tests on code suggestions from GitHub Copilot Chat. This feature helps developers quickly evaluate the quality and correctness of AI-generated code by:

1. Running tests on code blocks extracted from Copilot Chat suggestions
2. Automatically generating test templates when no tests are provided
3. Displaying test execution results in the TDD Dashboard
4. Providing visual feedback on test success or failure

## Key Components

### Enhanced run_test_execution.py

The `run_test_execution.py` script in the `examples` directory has been enhanced with:

- JSON input/output format support for programmatic use
- Automatic test template generation using language-specific templates
- Improved error handling and result formatting
- Support for both command-line and programmatic usage

Example JSON input format:

```json
{
  "implementation_code": "def add(a, b):\n    return a + b",
  "language": "python",
  "generate_test": true,
  "task_description": "Create a function that adds two numbers",
  "iteration": 1
}
```

### Copilot Chat Integration

The `copilot_chat_integration.js` module now includes:

- Automatic test execution on GitHub Copilot Chat code blocks
- Integration with the TDD dashboard to display test results
- Configuration options for enabling/disabling test execution

### TDD Dashboard Enhancements

The TDD Dashboard in the VS Code extension has been updated to:

- Display GitHub Copilot test execution results with special styling
- Provide configuration options for showing/hiding Copilot test results
- Allow viewing both test and implementation code from Copilot suggestions
- Show clear visual indicators for GitHub Copilot sourced test results

## Usage

### Configuration Options

The following configuration options are available in VS Code settings:

- `aiDevelopmentMonitor.autoRunTestsOnSuggestions`: Automatically run tests on GitHub Copilot Chat suggestions
- `aiDevelopmentMonitor.tdd.showExecutionResults`: Show test execution results in the TDD Dashboard
- `aiDevelopmentMonitor.tdd.includeGithubCopilotResults`: Include GitHub Copilot Chat test results in the TDD Dashboard

### Viewing Test Results

1. Open the AI Development Monitor panel in VS Code
2. Navigate to the TDD Dashboard tab
3. GitHub Copilot test results will appear with special highlighting and a "GH" indicator
4. Click "View Code" to see both the implementation and test code

### Running Tests Manually

You can also run tests on code snippets manually:

```bash
python examples/run_test_execution.py --json code_and_test.json
```

Or using the traditional command-line interface:

```bash
python examples/run_test_execution.py --test test_file.py --impl implementation.py --language python
```

## Implementation Details

The test execution process follows these steps:

1. When a GitHub Copilot Chat message contains code blocks, they are extracted
2. A temporary JSON file is created with the implementation code and language
3. The `run_test_execution.py` script is called with the JSON file
4. If no tests are available, a basic test template is generated
5. Tests are executed using the appropriate language-specific runner
6. Results are parsed and sent to the TDD Dashboard for display
7. The user is notified of the test execution results

## Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements for future versions include:

- More sophisticated test generation for complex code suggestions
- Integration with code coverage tools for GitHub Copilot suggestions
- Comparative analysis between human-written and AI-generated code
- Historical tracking of GitHub Copilot test performance metrics

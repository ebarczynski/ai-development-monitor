# C++23 Support in AI Development Monitor

This document describes the C++23 features supported by the AI Development Monitor system's test generation capabilities.

## Overview

The AI Development Monitor now includes comprehensive support for C++23 features in its test generation and evaluation pipelines. This support allows developers working with modern C++ codebases to generate tests that leverage the latest language features.

## Key C++23 Features Supported

1. **Error Handling with `std::expected<T, E>`**
   - Modern error handling without exceptions
   - Monadic operations: `and_then`, `or_else`, `transform`
   - Error propagation patterns

2. **Formatting and Output**
   - `std::print` for formatted console output
   - `std::format` for string formatting
   - Custom formatters via `std::formatter` specializations

3. **Module System**
   - Module imports/exports
   - Module isolation testing
   - Proper module dependency testing

4. **New Language Features**
   - `auto(x)` shorthand for lambdas
   - `if consteval` for compile-time conditionals
   - Improved metaprogramming capabilities

5. **Comparison Support**
   - Spaceship operator (`<=>`) testing
   - Three-way comparison ordering tests

6. **Concurrency Improvements**
   - `std::barrier` and `std::latch` for synchronization
   - Thread safety testing with modern primitives

## Test Generation

The AI Development Monitor generates C++23-aware tests across all 5 TDD iterations:

1. **Basic Tests**: Simple functionality verification with C++23 syntax
2. **Extended Tests**: Parameterized tests and fixtures with C++23 features
3. **Error Handling**: Testing error paths with `std::expected<T, E>`
4. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Mock objects with C++23 features
5. **Integration & Robustness**: Multi-threading and advanced pattern testing

## Example Usage

The system includes example files demonstrating C++23 features and tests:

- `examples/cpp23/cpp23_features.cpp` - Shows core C++23 language features
- `examples/cpp23/cpp23_test_example.cpp` - Demonstrates tests using C++23 features

## Task Analysis

The task analyzer has been updated to recognize C++23 specific patterns and will suggest appropriate testing approaches based on the code's use of modern features.

## Quality Metrics

Test quality metrics now include checks for proper usage of C++23 features, ensuring that tests take advantage of the language's modern capabilities.

Evaluation Results:
Accept: False
Hallucination Risk: 0.0
Recursive Risk: 1.0
Alignment Score: 0.9

Issues Detected:
- The provided factorial function is recursive and does not include a base case or a mechanism to stop the recursion. Without a stopping condition, it will result in a stack overflow error for non-negative integer inputs.
- The code is functionally correct for non-negative integers, but the recursive implementation is generally less efficient and more prone to errors than an iterative approach.

Recommendations:
- Add a stopping condition to the recursive function, typically through a `while` loop and a counter, to ensure it terminates.
- Consider implementing an iterative solution for the factorial function to improve performance and avoid potential stack overflow errors.
- Include a docstring explaining the function's purpose, arguments, and return value.

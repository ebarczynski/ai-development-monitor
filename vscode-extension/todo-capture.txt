# ToDo: Fix GitHub Copilot Chat Integration

## 1. Improve WebView Capturing Mechanism
- [ ] Replace DOM manipulation approach with the VS Code WebView API
- [ ] Implement messaging protocol compatible with VS Code's security model
- [ ] Add robust error handling for webview communication
- [ ] Add detailed logging for webview communication attempts

## 2. Fix Message Event Handling
- [ ] Create a unified message handler that works with all Copilot Chat message formats
- [ ] Implement separate processors for different message types (user queries, AI responses, code blocks)
- [ ] Add message validation to prevent processing of malformed messages
- [ ] Implement robust message sequencing to properly pair queries with responses

## 3. Enhance Context Extraction Logic
- [ ] Refactor extractContextFromChat() to be more resilient to different chat patterns
- [ ] Improve code block extraction with better regex patterns
- [ ] Add language detection for extracted code blocks
- [ ] Create a more robust algorithm for pairing user queries with AI responses containing code

## 4. Add Comprehensive Debugging Support
- [ ] Add detailed logging points throughout the chat capture process
- [ ] Create a diagnostic mode that shows exactly what's being captured
- [ ] Add a command to manually trigger chat capture with verbose output
- [ ] Create a dedicated diagnostics panel for chat integration issues

## 5. Fix Context Manager Integration
- [ ] Ensure consistent context update patterns across all components
- [ ] Verify bidirectional communication between chat integration and context manager
- [ ] Add validation for context updates
- [ ] Implement better source tracking for context data

## 6. Implement Direct Copilot API Integration (if available)
- [ ] Research if GitHub Copilot exposes any official APIs for chat integration
- [ ] Implement direct integration with Copilot's extension API if available
- [ ] Add fallback mechanisms if direct API access isn't available

## 7. Add User Feedback Mechanisms
- [ ] Add status indicators showing when chat content is successfully captured
- [ ] Create notification system for chat capture events
- [ ] Add manual correction capabilities for misinterpreted content
- [ ] Implement confidence scoring for extracted context

## 8. Add Reliability Improvements
- [ ] Implement retry mechanisms for failed extractions
- [ ] Add session persistence for chat history
- [ ] Create background polling as an alternative to event-based capturing
- [ ] Implement heartbeat checks to detect if chat integration is working

## 9. Ensure Clean Extension Lifecycle
- [ ] Fix resource cleanup in dispose() method
- [ ] Ensure all event listeners are properly removed
- [ ] Verify that timers are cleared on deactivation
- [ ] Add graceful error handling for lifecycle events

## 10. Testing Strategy
- [ ] Create test scenarios for different chat interaction patterns
- [ ] Develop mocks for Copilot Chat interface
- [ ] Implement automated tests for chat extraction logic
- [ ] Add manual test procedure documentation
